        Famed DJ and musician Don Diablo just shook up the NFT world by
        releasing the first full length NFT concert. Mixing music, visuals, and
        a recorded studio performance into a digital concert, this virtual show
        is guaranteed to be engaging and entertaining. To initiate the sale of
        the full show, Don Diablo and his team chose to issue a unique one of
        one NFT, DΞSTINATION HΞXAGONIA by Don Diablo. Sold via auction on
        SuperRare, this NFT just broke records with a winning bid of 600 ETH,
        worth $1,265,016.00 at the time of the sale.

      <p>
        The winning bid was placed by the anonymous user @deckchair. This was
        his first NFT purchase using that account. According to the contract,
        @deckchair will be receiving a unique box containing a hard drive with
        “the only copy” of the concert file. While I have no doubt that Don
        Diablo is a man of his word and will make sure @deckchair receives his
        hard drive, this model of distribution is simply not sustainable. At
        worst, it’s downright negligent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting a single copy of a digital file on a single physical hard drive
        is a terrible idea. Personally, I have suffered multiple hard drive
        failures and I would absolutely hate to see this recording disappear due
        to drive failure. I encourage Don Diablo to find a better solution. In
        the transfer of this box, will Don Diablo or a trusted third party get
        on a plane and fly to @deckchair? How will @deckchair receive this file
        and remain anonymous? Would Don Diablo consider putting a hard drive
        worth over a million dollars in the mail?
      </p>

        While there is no doubt that this performance is groundbreaking, and I
        congratulate Don Diablo on the success of the auction, there is a lot to
        learn from the first NFT Concert drop. Due to the success, the demand
        for full length NFT experiences will be rapidly exploding. NFT Concerts
        is a platform currently under development that will address many of
        these issues.

        NFT Concerts plans to allow artists at any level to quickly and easily
        launch their own full length NFT Concerts. By using non-fungible tokens
        to unlock on-demand streaming access to show recordings, NFT Concerts
        will maintain an extremely high resale value. NFT Concerts will be
        stored and streamed in encrypted shards, preventing the ability for a
        bad actor to duplicate the original file in its entirety. Additionally,
        there is no need to mail a hard drive around the world. A transfer of
        the NFT will immediately unlock access to the streaming recording for
        the purchaser while removing access for the seller. If you would like to
        learn more about NFT Concerts, please visit{" "}

        currently lining up our initial public offering of NFT Concerts. Please
