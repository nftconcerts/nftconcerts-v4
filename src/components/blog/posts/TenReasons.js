        At <a href="/">NFT Concerts</a>, our goal is simple – transform live
        performances into digital collectibles using NFTs. Our platform will
        offer full length concert recordings unlocked by non-fungible tokens.
        But why would you want to do this?

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">Save the Music</span> – By recording the
          concert, you are capturing a piece of music history. Music is
          constantly evolving, and every live show is unique. Record every show
          as you never know what may happen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">Grow Your Available Content</span> – As
          an artist in the digital era, constant content creation is essentially
          a requirement. Take the difficulty out of creating new content by
          releasing your concert recordings. Grow your online presence and give
          fans more opportunities to enjoy your art at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">Get Attention </span>– NFTs are still new
          and unique. Take advantage of the hype by tapping into NFT market
          early. By creating a NFT Concert, you may find yourself generating
          headlines around the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">
            Generate Additional Revenue from Your Performance
          </span>{" "}
          – Take advantage of an existing performance obligation and generate
          existing revenue by offering that performance recording to your global
          fanbase in the form of a NFT Concert.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">
            Add a Resale Fee to Generate Revenue Indefinitely{" "}
          </span>
          – Because we use NFTs to gate access to content, Artists can now set a
          resale fee. Generate revenue indefinitely as your fans continue to buy
          and sell your existing NFTs. This is a particularly amazing feature
          for artists early in their career who release a NFT Concert and then
          blow up.

            Fans Do Not Have to Rely on Their Phones to Capture the Moment{" "}
          </span>
          – We’ve all been stuck behind that guy that will not put his phone
          down at the show. Let fans know the show is already being recorded to
          just enjoy the moment. There is a demand for concert recordings.
          Fulfill that demand with high quality official recordings instead of
          unstable cell phone footage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">
            It’s Hard to Write Songs but Fun to Play Shows{" "}
          </span>
          – New music is essential for an artist to grow, but it is extremely
          difficult and time consuming to create. Bridge the income gaps between
          album releases by releasing your live performances as NFT Concerts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">Every Performance is Unique</span> – I’ve
          seen the same artist play the same set at two different shows, and
          each experience was vastly different. There is no such thing as the
          same live show. Not to mention, there may be personal moments felt by
          your fans at a particular show. A fan falling in love or overcoming
          grief may make a particular live set priceless to that individual.
          Release all your show recordings as you never know what that set means
          to someone else.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">
            As the Artist, You Have Full Control Over the Quantity and Price
            Point. Offer 1 Token or 10,000{" "}
          </span>
          – At NFT Concerts, we enable artists to monetize their live sets
          through exclusivity. However, we let the artist decide exactly how
          exclusive they would like to make their content. Release a single
          token for an expensive price or put out thousands for cheap. It’s up
          to the artist and each show can be different.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold__text">
            Maintain 100% of Your Music Rights{" "}
          </span>
          – A NFT Concert is the perfect NFT offering for a musician looking to
          tap into the NFT world but maintain 100% of their music rights. There
          are several companies working on selling your music rights via NFTs,
          but unless you are at the peak of your career selling your music
          rights is a mistake. While sell today if it will be worth more
          tomorrow? Keep ownership over your music while still offering fans a
          valuable digital collectible by releasing a NFT Concert.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        While this list stops at 10, there are plenty of additional benefits to
        releasing a NFT Concert. If you’re an artist, we want you to release
        your performances as NFT Concerts. Any and all artists are welcome. Be
        sure to fill out our <a href="/apply">Artist Application</a> as we are
