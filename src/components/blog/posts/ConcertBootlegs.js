        Concert bootlegs, or unofficial live music recordings have a long and
        storied history in the music world. For as long as there has been the
        ability to record sound, people have recorded live music. The oldest
        surviving live concert performance is{" "}

        While official concert recordings were a regular occurrence,
        unofficially bootlegging shows turned into an art form in the 1960’s.
        Bob Dylan was among the first artist to have a unofficial bootleg boost
        his prominence. There were even famous bootleggers such as “Dub”, an
        amateur sound engineer and Rolling Stones fanatic who recorded a number
        of shows on the their first U.S. tour and released the prominent
        bootleg, Live’r Than You’ll Ever Be.

        In the 1970’s full on bootleg labels rose to prominence. Bootlegs grew
        more and more mainstream through the 1980’s and 90’s, as recording
        equipment became more accessible to a large portion of the population.
        The bootleg market grew oversaturated, and only high-quality rare
        recordings were selling for a profit.

        In the 2000’s, the rise of the internet revolutionized bootleg
        distribution. Full length concerts are routinely uploaded to YouTube,
        often without the artist permission. While copyright holders can now
        make claims against this content, they will forever be fighting an
        uphill battle. Currently, artists are left with the choice but to
        publicly release their live show recordings or keep them locked away and
        allow bootleggers to fulfill the demand.

        Current distribution methods for live show recordings are extremely poor
        at monetizing their value. YouTube or Soundcloud ad revenue is minuscule
        and everyone hates advertisements in the middle of a performance. NFT
        Concerts plans to fix this. Artists will now be able to extract the true
        value from their live show recordings. By using NFT’s to grant access to
        stream the uninterrupted recording, NFT Concerts can protect the
        official recording from unauthorized viewers while granting owners
        access to a unique digital asset. Fans can sell or swap access to
        different show recordings at a fair market value, and the artist can set
        a resale fee to ensure they get a piece of the action. If you are an
        artist looking to properly monetize your live show recordings,{" "}
