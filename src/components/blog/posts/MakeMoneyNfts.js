        Musicians and bands are entering the NFT market at a rapid pace. While
        many musicians are entering the NFT space, there have been several
        different NFT implementations that various artist have used. Here’s 5
        different ways musicians can make money with NFTs.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">1. Mint Your Songs</h3>
      <p>
        Upload and mint NFTs to your songs. Offer ownership over your music to
        your fans. The world’s largest online NFT marketplace,{" "}
        <a href="https://opensea.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          OpenSea
        </a>{" "}
        allows for uploads of MP3 or WAV files. Upload your track through their
        easy-to-use user interface and sell ownership over your music.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a music only site, be sure to check out{" "}
        <a href="https://mintsongs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Mint Songs
        </a>
        . This Polygon Network based service allows musicians to mint their
        songs for free. Just be aware, while these services will allow you to
        sell your music as NFTs, by uploading to these services, your music will
        be public, and anyone will be able to download the track. While there
        may not be a download button pictured, the file is public and has no
        data protections on playback or downloads.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        2. Turn Your Live Concert Recordings into NFT Concerts
      </h3>
      <p>
        Turn your full length concert recordings into an exclusive digital
        collectible with <a href="/">NFT Concerts</a>. Our unique implementation
        uses the public NFTs as a key to unlock and stream encrypted private
        concert recordings. Think of the bootleg recordings of old – there were
        only so many copies of a single show. Those bootleg recordings were
        coveted and passed from fan to fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        At NFT Concerts, we are restoring the idea of a limited concert
        recording using non-fungible tokens. Instead of bootlegs, we offer
        artists (or content owners) the ability to release legitimate
        high-quality recordings to their fans in limited quantities. We mint a
        unique set of NFTs that grant access to that concert recording. It is
        public knowledge how many NFTs grant access to the show, ensuring
        content exclusivity and offering real value for the owners of that NFT.
        These NFTs are then sold to fans and our streaming platform checks for
        ownership of that required NFT for access to be granted to the viewer.
      </p>

        If you want to generate additional revenue from your live concert
        recordings, be sure to check out the{" "}
        <a href="/apply">NFT Concerts Artists</a> page for more details.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        3. Team Up with a Visual Artist for a NFT Art Drop
      </h3>
      <p>
        Digitally designed visual art, particularly animation was at the
        forefront of the NFT world. Early sales of digital visual artworks
        helped prove the NFT model to the world. Most NFT marketplaces were set
        up to sell visual art first and have been adding support for additional
        file formats and mediums as they build out. Visual art still dominates a
        large portion of sales, and many NFT investors are still most
        comfortable buying a piece of digital art that has a visual component.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, many musicians started{" "}

        >
          teaming up with visual artists
        </a>
        . Attach some of your music to an animated clip or image that fits the
        mood and turn that into a traditional NFT. List for sale on any NFT
        marketplace and be sure to market to both of your fanbases. Just be sure
        to come to an agreement on the finances beforehand.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">4. Start an NFT Fan Club</h3>
      <p>
        Zhu made headlines earlier this year when they announced their plans to
        build an{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.the360mag.com/zhu-x-dreamrocks-nfts/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          NFT based fan community
        </a>
        . Offering free NFTs to the attendees of their six-night run at Red
        Rocks, Zhu plans to be the first to do a more fan focused NFT effort.
        Community members will get exclusive access to merch, content, and event
        presales.

        . Their agency has been involved in several high-profile music NFT
        projects, including Kings of Leon’s When You See Yourself NFT album
        drop.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">5. Release Your Album as an NFT</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than mint a single song as an NFT, release your whole album as an
        NFT. While this sounds simple, the beauty of smart contracts ensures
        this can be done in a variety of manners. For the{" "}

        copy of the album, one type that included visual artwork, and one type
        that had live event perks.

        Or you can copy the Damon Dash approach and sell actual ownership over a
        portion of the album (and all future proceeds generated by that portion
        of the album) as an NFT. While that didn’t work out so well for Dash
        when he tried to{" "}

        market, list, and sell that asset, the concept is sound. If it was

      <h3 className="company__name">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        While there are many options for musicians to enter the NFT space, we
        encourage artists to do their homework before deciding. Don’t simply
        take advantage of the hype. Offer your fans a digital asset that will
        have lasting value. Put the time, thought, and effort into creating a
        memorable digital asset. If you would like more information about NFT
