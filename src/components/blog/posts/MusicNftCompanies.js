        With the crypto market crashing and exceptional volatility in both coins
        and NFTs, investors may be considering safer options. While there is no
        telling where any individual NFT will head, there is no doubt that NFTs
        will continue to be created, issued, and sold for the foreseeable
        future. If you want to tap into the potential growth of blockchain
        technology in an intelligent manner, consider betting on an NFT company.
        These 5 NFT platforms are quickly developing alternative NFT release
        methods geared towards the music industry.{" "}

      <h3 className="company__name">5. ROCKI</h3>
      <p>
        A unique music streaming platform powered by the ROCKI token. ROCKI pays
        per stream for music on their platform. Featuring a subscription model
        that can be paid in both FIAT or cryptocurrency, ROCKI pays out a much
        higher rate than traditional streaming platforms. Each song uploaded to
        ROCKI is backed by a NFT to ensure proof of ownership. ROCKI has rolled
        out Staking for Artists, essential using DEFI principles to reward both
        individual artists and their fans willing to commit their ROCKI tokens.
      </p>
      <p>
        ROCKI is built on the Binance Smart Chain which has very low transaction
        fees. ROCKI is clearly innovating and deploying features from around the
        cryptocurrency world and adapting them for use with music. Suffering
        from the recent collapse in coin prices, ROCKIâ€™s coin market cap is
        currently around $1.35 million and they have announced additional
        fundraising of close to $1 million with investors such as Black Dog
        Venture Partners. Expect this unique platform to continue to grow and
        flourish.

      <h3 className="company__name">4. OneOf</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps one of the best known NFT companies in the music scene, OneOf
        has issues NFTs for superstars such as Whitney Houston, Doja Cat, The
        Game, and Alesso. They have upcoming drop of NFTs commemorating the
        Grammy Awards. OneOf is already tapping into an elite tier of artists
        and businesses. While issuing a number of successful drops, OneOf does
        not stick to a standard model. Each drop is unique and tailored to the
        artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there is no doubt that OneOf will continue to find success, they
        charge high upfront fees to develop a NFT package that will be out of
        reach for most smaller artists. This truly is a NFT company geared
        towards offering elite experiences and their model has already proven
        successful. OneOf is built on Tezos blockchain and has raised an
        astounding $63 million in funding from Tezos Foundation, Sangha Capital,
        and a few individual investors.

      <h3 className="company__name">3. Mint Songs</h3>
      <p>
        A fantastic platform allowing artist to tokenize their music with NFTs.
        Sporting a fresh redesign and fully launched to the public, Mint Songs
        is seeing instant adoption by independent artists. Utilizing the Polygon
        blockchain and taking advantage of low transaction fees, Artists are
        encouraged to issue 10-25 NFTs per song and price them at $2-3. As a
        result, these music NFTs are an affordable way for fans to get a unique
        digital collectible and an easy way for artists to grow their fanbase in
        the metaverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mint Songs recently announced a successful raise of $3 million in a seed
        round featuring investors of the quality of Coinbase Ventures, Dapper
        Labs, and Freestyle. Lead by a professional and quickly growing team,
        Mint Songs is bound for success. As an increasing number of artists want
        to tap into the NFT space with their music, Mint Songs easy uploader and
        helpful guides can help artists start earning today. One of my personal
        friends who is an independent musician managed to sell his first NFT
        through Mint Songs.

      <h3 className="company__name">2. Royal</h3>
      <p>
        Royal is the new kid on the block and is already making a massive
        splash. Founded by the NFT king, Justin Blau (3LAU), Royal is focused on
        selling the right to music royalties via NFTs. Their first drop featured
        Nas and generated such a buzz that the site crashed. They rescheduled
        the release for the following week, beefed up on servers, and had a
        successful NFT drop that sold out in minutes. Nas was able to sell over
        $560,000 for 50% of the streaming royalties generated by the songs Ultra
        Black and Rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Royal gives fans the ability to invest in their favorite artist with
        royalty-bearing NFTs that earn while you own them. This unique
        technology is set to revolutionize the industry and Royal is already
        seeing backing from major artists and investors. Royal has raised an
        astounding $71 million in funding from investors including a16z, The
        Chainsmokers, DJ Kygo, Blockchain Founders Fund, and others.

      <h3 className="company__name">1. NFT Concerts</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, I admit a little bias here, but I believe this prediction will
        prove true. With plans to launch in February, NFT Concerts is bringing
        ability for fans to Own the Show. By issuing NFTs that unlock access to
        stream a unique concert recording, NFT Concerts will enable fans to
        re-watch their favorite performances on demand. By utilizing the NFT as
        an access token, owners will be aware of exactly how many tokens are
        issued per show. They have ownership over that NFT and as such will have
        the ability to resell that NFT in the future for a price of their
        choosing. This allows artists to ditch ad-revenue and subscription based
        distribution models and monetize their show recordings direct to fans
        through an exclusive set of NFTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        NFT Concerts is unique in that non-fungible tokens can be issued on both
        the Ethereum Mainnet and the Polygon Network and both offer the same
        unlock functionality. We are proud to offer content protection and
        distribution. Artists will have a simple uploader and minter to choose
        the number of tokens per show, as well as attach any secret additional
        bonus content to that show recording to create a unique digital
        collectible for that performance. All NFT Concerts will feature a music
        performance of at least 20 minutes and artist are encouraged to do
        minimal post-production (leave in the breaks). NFT Concerts platform
        will be open to artists of all sizes.
