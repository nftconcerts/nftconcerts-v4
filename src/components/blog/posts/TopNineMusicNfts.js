        NFTs continue to make headlines in the music industry as more and more
        artists are discovering the economic potential of non-fungible tokens.
        While several big musicians have released various NFTs projects, there
        has been minimal analysis on the efficacy of these campaigns. In this
        article, we are going to look at 9 music NFT projects in order of
        success.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        9. A$AP Rocky –{" "}
        <a

        >
          ROCKY GATEWAY
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While this NFT project did manage to sell a little over $200,000 worth
        of digital collectibles at various levels, based off the size of A$AP
        Rocky’s fanbase it was a statistical failure. With over 17,150,000
        monthly Spotify listeners, A$AP Rocky is a mega star. This NFT project
        brought in a little over $0.01 per fan. Mediocre marketing and a clear
        separation between the A$AP Rocky and the NFTs being released
        contributed to the overall failure of this campaign.

        8. Tory Lanez –{" "}

          href="https://www.e-nft.com/marketplace-listings/?item=0x9e6a55b6b4563e652a23be9d623ca5055c356940"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          When It’s Dark
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While this NFT project made massive headlines by selling $1,000,000
        worth of $1 NFTs that offer the owners access to the new album When It’s
        Dark, based off Tory Lanez’s fanbase this project left plenty of money
        on the table. With over 16,700,000 monthly Spotify followers, the When
        It’s Dark NFT release generated a miniscule $0.06 per fan.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        7. Snoop Dogg –{" "}
        <a
          href="https://crypto.com/nft/drops-event/80b2e021d4cbfbc43789db5377ecf1ed"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          A Journey with the Dogg
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While it is hard to call a NFT release with over $1,500,000 in sales a
        failure, based off Snoop Dogg’s massive fanbase there was potential for
        this NFT release to set records. Snoop Dogg is one of the most
        well-known individuals in the entire world, with over 134,000,000
        followers across his various social media followings. Considering only
        his music fans, with over 21,000,000 monthly Spotify listener, this NFT
        auction only brought in $0.07 per fan.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        6. Balkan Bump –{" "}
        <a
          href="https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/the-winner-is...-22108"

        >
          The Winner Is…
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While Balkan Bump is certainly the smallest artist on this list by
        current fanbase size, his unique NFT offering produced surprisingly
        great results. The Winner Is… was an NFT drop where the winner received
        the opportunity to name a song on his new album. This offering proved
        popular with his fanbase. While the auction for this single NFT only
        brought in ~$10,000, with total monthly Spotify listeners round 70,000,
        this NFT release generated $0.14 cents per fan. This release showed that
        you don’t need to have a massive fanbase to start taking advantage of
        the potential of NFTs.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        5. Kings of Leon –{" "}
        <a
          href="https://yh.io/nft-collection/kings-of-leon-nft-yourself-collection/3"
          target="_blank"

        >
          NFT Yourself Collection
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        This was one of the first music NFT releases to gain national headlines.
        Releasing their new album as an NFT generated a ton of press and over
        $2,500,000 of NFT sales. There is no denying that this NFT release was a
        massive success. With over 12,000,000 monthly Spotify listeners, this
        NFT release generated a respectable $0.21 per fan while showcasing the
        potential of NFTs to the music world.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        4. deadmau5 –{" "}
        <a
          href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/deadmau5"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Slickmau5
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        It should come as no surprise that deadmau5 successfully released his
        NFT collection, Slickmau5. As one of the most technically savvy
        electronic musicians, deadmau5 and his team showcased a solid
        understanding of the NFT market with this timely release of unique
        collectibles. Bringing in over $900,000 of NFT sales and with 4,150,000
        monthly Spotify listeners, the Slickmau5 generated $0.22 per fan.

          HEXAGONIA
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While this NFT release was promoted as the first ‘NFT Concert’, in
        reality it was a virtual performance that can only be enjoyed by the
        single owner. There were numerous issues with the implementation of this
        NFT release, mainly the fact that the recording was going to be mailed
        on a single USB flash drive. However, this NFT release proved to be
        financially successful. Selling for the equivalent of $2,000,000, this
        NFT release generated over $0.23 per fan and showed that there is real
        demand for an <a href="/">NFT Concert platform</a> that allows for the
        distribution of concert recordings using NFTs.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        2. Gramatik –{" "}
        <a
          href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/gramatik"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Purple Queens
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Gramatik is a legend in the crypto scene, and his fanbase definitely
        turned out for his NFT auction. As a well-known electronic music artist,
        Gramatik made headlines way back in 2017 when he released his own coin
        and raised $2,000,000 in 24 hours. It comes as no surprise that Gramatik
        was among the first to take advantage of the NFT pop. The Purple Queens
        NFT release proved immensely popular, selling over $1,500,000 of NFT
        collectibles. With a relatively niche fanbase and only 1,000,000 monthly
        Spotify listeners (of which I am certainly 1), this NFT release
        generated a whopping $1.54 per fan.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">
        1. 3LAU –{" "}
        <a
          href="https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Ultraviolet Collection
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is simply no denying that 3LAU is the king of NFTs. This NFT drop
        should be studied by anyone looking to get into the NFT space. This was
        a world record NFT release, generating over $11,600,000 in a single
        auction for 33 unique tokens. While 3LAU has a decent size fanbase, with
        over 2,500,000 monthly Spotify listeners, this NFT auction was able to
        generate a truly ridiculous $4.64 per fan.
      </p>
      <h3 className="company__name">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        NFTs and music are a perfect combo. NFTs are still so new, and have so
        much potential, that there has been a variety of NFT releases that
        attempt to merge musicians and NFTs with varying degrees of success. For
        the first time, we can compare these methods and determine which NFT
        release method will be the most effective for musicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        From looking at these NFT releases, it’s clear that fans can tell when
        an artist is taking the lead on their NFT project. Snoop and A$AP
        outsourced their creations and received minimal support. While Gramatik
        and 3LAU were hands on in their NFT projects. It’s good to see the NFT
        community rewarding effort and ingenuity.{" "}
